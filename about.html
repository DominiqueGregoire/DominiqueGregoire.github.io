                <h2>How we started</h2>
                <p> This all started with the one of us needing a new outfit and looking online. We found the
                perfect one online, looked at the sizing and purchased it. The outfit arrived a few days later and
                she tried it on ... only to find that it was too big and looked dreadful. After a few tears and a
                cocktail or two, we decided that we would try to make an app that solved this dilemma that every
                woman goes through. And that is how Fit me Perfectly was born.</p>
