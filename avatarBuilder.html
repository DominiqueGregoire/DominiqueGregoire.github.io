                <p>To build your avatar we require that you take 4 photos of yourself in a bathing suit.
                This is so that we can tailor make your avatar to be as lifelike as possible. Once the photos
                have been put into our avatar builder, they are destroyed. This is because a woman's body shape
                    changes over time. If you increase/decrease in weight, then you will have to alter your avatar.
                    We require front view, back view, and two side views. Please take your photos in natural light
                    so that we can match your complexion and skin colour. This is important because some colours
                    can enhance your complexion while others may drain it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, this is the hardest part, but we need to know your measurements. The usual hip, waist, chest
                and buttocks, as well as arm and thigh circumference. This allows us to assist you in sizing. Every
                country has different sizes and a medium in one country may be a small in another.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once this is done we let our AI do its work and all you then have to do is link the shopping
                site with your avatar. Your avatar will then go into the dressing room and when she comes out you
                can decide whether you want to purchase the item or keep looking.
